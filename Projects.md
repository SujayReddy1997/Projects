# Active Directory SOC Lab:
- Simulated an Active Directory environment in a local network with 5 systems, 1 AD.
- Carried through a successful breach on a machine within the network then on Active Directory with password spraying attack, performed lateral movement to breach additional systems, showing the expertise in pivoting & expanding access.
- Extracted log files from individual endpoint machines, ingested those into Splunk for effective log management, conducted root cause investigation by implementing searches on 15000+ events for login activities, bruteforce attacks, threat analysis using event IDs, source & destination Ip addresses, ports to identify and correlate attack vectors, artifacts.
- Identified and documented 10+ attack vectors with remediation for each system, providing crucial insights for improving security measures, increasing endpoint protection, and prevention of future breaches.

# SOC Analyst Pathway Project | Let's Defend Platform:
- Assigned and triaged 38 tickets with severities ranging from medium, high, and critical as a Level 1 SOC Analyst, following established runbooks, playbooks and standard operating procedures considering severity and impact.
- Investigated alerts related to activities such as brute force, DOS/DDOS attacks, ransomware, phishing emails, and malicious documents by utilizing 1000+ logs from SIEM, 40+ endpoint systems from EDR and threat intelligence data to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), root cause and suspicious activity.
- Implemented effective response actions for true positive alerts and escalation, reporting for confirmed security issues to Incident Response IR teams, while promptly closing false positive alerts with detailed explanations.
- Quarantined compromised systems and applied temporary measures for containment of the threat, included MD5 hash values, malicious URLs, and other indicator in the report for further mitigation of similar incidents.
