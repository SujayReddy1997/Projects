# Active Directory SOC Lab:
- Simulated an Active Directory environment in a local network with 5 systems, 1 AD.
- Carried through a successful breach on a machine within the network then on Active Directory with password spraying attack, performed lateral movement to breach additional systems, showing the expertise in pivoting & expanding access.
- Extracted log files from individual endpoint machines, ingested those into Splunk for effective log management, conducted root cause investigation by implementing searches on 15000+ events for login activities, bruteforce attacks, threat analysis using event IDs, source & destination Ip addresses, ports to identify and correlate attack vectors, artifacts.
- Identified and documented 10+ attack vectors with remediation for each system, providing crucial insights for improving security measures, increasing endpoint protection, and prevention of future breaches.
